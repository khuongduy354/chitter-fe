# Chitter
React Frontend for a realtime chat app, with customizeable themes, emojis and parallax backgrounds for chat room.
Backend: https://github.com/khuongduy354/chitter

# Features  
- Google OAuth Authentication
- 1-1 realtime chat
- Groups: create groups, realtime group chat
- Add Friends 
- Upload custom emojis and use for chat messages
- Parallax Background editor and apply these backgrounds for chat panel 
- Save themes configs: message colors, backgrounds used,...

# Why   
- Messager app default themes aren't enough for me, I want themes (backgrounds, msg colors,...) to be created by users. 
- Message Panel receives lots of scrolling by users, and I notice Parallax Background also works best by scrolling, so I combine the two.

# Quick Start 
```
git clone https://github.com/khuongduy354/chitter-fe.git 
cd chitter-fe
npm install   
npm start
```
